 Trivia Murder Party 2 Cheatsheet

Had some time to kill and found the questions and answers from the Jackbox Party Pack game Trivia Murder Party 2.

The said file was in a different file format but the text formatting is very similar to JSON. It had a lot of unnecessary characters so I had to use Python to read it's contents, clean, and turn it into a proper JSON text formating.

Creating the cheat sheet itself is just a simple search for the string and find possible matches. The cheatsheet is divided to two sections as the final part of the game can have multiple correct answers.
